A twitch-y game for learning Leap Motion coding.

A player gets three turns. The goal is to complete them as quickly as possible. At the beginning of a turn the game asks the player to hold up a certain number of fingers. Once the Leap sees that the player has done that, the turn is over. The player's score at the end of the game is their total time.
